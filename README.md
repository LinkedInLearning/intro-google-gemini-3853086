In this course, instructor Lynn Langit shows you how to get started using the design patterns, tools, and features of Google Gemini following the best practices for building LLM-based applications.

Explore the capabilities of Google Gemini starting with Google AI Studio, before diving into the development, testing, and deployment of even larger, more complex models. Along the way, Lynn shows you how to use Gemini notebooks in GCP Vertex AI Studio and Gemini applications on GCP.
